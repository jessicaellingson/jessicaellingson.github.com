    <h1>Glucosense</h1>
    <h2>2009</h2>
    <p>Glucosense is the new revolutionary smart dust chip that can test blood sugar levels through the breath. When blood sugar levels in the body are too high, body tissues become damaged and release high levels of methyl nitrate through the breath. A Glucosense chip is implanted in a molar to constantly monitor these levels of methyl  nitrate, thus eliminating the need to check blood sugar with the blood using needles and constant finger pricks. The blood sugar levels are then transmitted to a Glucosense program of choice, such a watch, phone application, or computer software, and the user can use these programs to track changes in their blood sugar levels and will be alerted when they become too high</p>
