    <p>As a graphic designer, I aim to create vibrant and detailed designs that incorporate unique illustrative elements, while keeping in mind standards and usability. My passions lie in the design of page layouts, packaging, and branding, as well as illustration and traditional art.</p>

    <p>In 2009, I graduated with a Bachelor of Fine Arts degree in Graphic Design from the University of Wisconsin- Stout, and began my journey as a designer by doing freelance design work for several small companies.</p>

    <p>I am currently living in Chicago, Illinois and am actively seeking both freelance work and a full-time design position.</p>

    <p>In my free time I like to cook, read, and create things with charcoal, acrylic paint, paper, yarn and anything else I can get my hands on.</p>
